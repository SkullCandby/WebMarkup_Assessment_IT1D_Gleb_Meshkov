        <p class="info_paragraphs">The use of virtual reality in various areas of life is growing steadily every year.
            Sports are no exception. The use of the possibilities of virtual reality in sports, including elite sports,
            has its advantages, but at the same time, its disadvantages, which will be discussed in this paper.</p>

        <p class="info_paragraphs">It is shown that the use of virtual reality technologies in sports has a whole range
            of advantages. They are due, in particular, to the removal of a number of restrictions imposed by real
            sports conditions. These technologies make it possible to prevent injury to athletes, allow the creation of
            any environmental conditions (weather, humidity), simulate different levels of training of rivals, and much
            more. Using the possibilities of virtual reality allows athletes not to depend on equipment, weather or
            competition venue, therefore they provide an opportunity to engage in hard-to-reach and expensive sports.</p>

        <p class="info_paragraphs">Starting this year, a training program has been launched for junior American football
            teams that allows using VR to demonstrate what happens with traumatic brain injuries, demonstrate the
            symptoms of a concussion and help young athletes recognize them in a timely manner. The program is called
            CrashCourse and is run jointly by American Youth Football & Cheer and TeachAids.</p>

        <p class="info_paragraphs">Many remember that the 2018 BBC already used AR and VR technology to broadcast the
            World Cup. Viewers got a 360-degree view of the game. The British football club Liverpool is working on a
            similar project. The club's administration understands that even in stadiums with thousands of people there
            is not always enough space for all the fans, and not all seats are successful. The club thought about using
            VR for more efficient broadcasting of the match. It is clear that the fan base will be able to experience
            stadium-like experiences with VR, and perhaps even stronger, as the filming will be done from better vantage
            points.</p>

        <p class="info_paragraphs">Thus, today we can state with certainty that virtual reality technologies most likely
            will not be able to completely replace the stands and the live presence of fans, but will significantly
            unload the stadiums. Also, systems based on the principles of augmented and virtual reality will help
            organize the training process more efficiently, which, obviously, can improve sports results, add to the
            entertainment of existing sports, and, possibly, accelerate the emergence of new world records.</p>

    <article id="sixth">
        <p class="info_paragraphs">Despite the conviction of skeptical citizens that stadiums are eternal and VR will
            never replace them, it can already be stated today that glasses will soon compete with noisy and cramped
            arenas. AR is also increasingly becoming part of the practice of both the training process and sports
            marketing, and its use in refereeing is no longer considered something new.</p>
